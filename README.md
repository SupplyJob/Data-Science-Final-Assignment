# Empirical Project: Data Science in Economics (BEE2041)

#  Project Overview
This project delve into how food inflation compares to overall inflation (CPIH) in the UK, and how does that affect households spending across income groups.  Using data from multiple source such as ONS, helps developed analysis and visualization to show the continous financial pressure on low-income groups, especially during an external shock. 

# Datasets Used
- Food Index (Excel)
- CPIH Annual Rate (CSV)
- Supermarket Price Comparison ([source](https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/supermarkets/article/food-price-inflation-tracker-aU2oV0A46tu3)) (HTML --> CSV)
- Median Weekly Earnings (CSV)
- Household Food Budget proportion (CSV)
- Detailed Expenditure Trends (Excel)

# Visualization & Analysis Conducted
- Food Price vs CPIH
- Different rates of price changes in UK supermarkets (Table)
- Weekly Earnings across types of employees
- Food Budget Comparsion and purchasing power gap
- Regression analysis by income decile
